# Overview 
Simple app for creating an overlay windows showing curently played song.

# Functionality
Not much, but here it is:
- double click to close the overlay (alt+f4 works as well)
- you can drag to reposition the window with your mouse

# Want more?
Just ask for features here, I might be interested in implementing those :)
